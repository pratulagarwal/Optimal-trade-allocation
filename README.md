# Optimal-trade-allocation
The power-percentile impact model - Suppose we want to sell a large number N shares of stock. Assuming the current price of stock is P0, the process of selling the stock will affect the price of the stock, with the result that the price will go down. Moreover, the trade will not be executed at once. We maybe able to sell k &lt; N number of shares at a time t, and the remaining N - k number of shares at time T - t. This algorithm determines optimal execution of the trade, by breaking the share allocation to n1, n2,,,,,,N over time periods t1, t2,....T, so as to maximize the revenue.
